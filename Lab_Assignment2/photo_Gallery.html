            <h2>Tasik Kenyir, Terengganu (2020)</h2>
            <p><a href="#"><img width="220" height="220" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/16.JPG"></a>
  			   I went on a holiday with my big family. It was on a houseboat that running on water all day long. Before it starts moving, I took this picture. It looks aesthetic here. Definitely one of my favorite.  </p>
         </div>

            <p><a href="#"><img width="220" height="220" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/03.jpg"></a>
  			   I was sight seeing from the 9th floor of my faculty building and I thought I would be a great view. Then I took out my phone and captured it. Turned out, I was right. It was a great view. I miss Raub's campus. It has so much hidden beauty. As example, this from this photo.  </p>

            <p><a href="#"><img width="220" height="220" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/14.JPG"></a>
  			   Have you ever heard the song "Mengintai Dari Tirai Kamar" by Exist? If I have to choose a song for this photo, I would definitely choose that song. That was my brother. I ask him to put his head out of the house boat window, then I took this shot. It was quite nice.   </p>

            <p><a href="#"><img width="220" height="220" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/28.JPG"></a>
  			   I've always love the sea, I can sit for hours at the beach just to stare at the sea, admiring it. I love how waves come and go repeatedly without tired. This is from my favorite beach, Teluk Chempedak. I used to go there almost every week just to admire its beauty.  </p>

  			   This shot what from my room windows, I was day-dreaming while looking out to the windows and I thought "hey, this looks aesthetic". Then I took out my phone and captured this shot. It was aesthetic and I love it! </p>

            <p><a href="#"><img width="220" height="220" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/21.JPG"></a>
  			   I was in Kuala Lumpur with my family. It was a busy day and the road pack with cars that stop while the traffic light is red. The day is gloomy. Randomly, I took out my phone and capture this view from the car windows. But hey, it turns out pretty decent.  </p>

            <p><a href="#"><img width="220" height="220" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/29.JPG"></a>
  			   I still remember it was monsun season for here, I was bored for staying inside my house for long time. Then, I took my umbrella and went for a walk. I was thinking, "I can make pretty good shot here, using my umbrella". I put my umbrella on the road and took this photo. It is not that great but still good. </p>

            <p><a href="#"><img width="220" height="220" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/30.JPG"></a>
  			   I was walking from my car to enter my house, then suddenly I saw this guy on a bike, assuming he was coming home from his work, I guess. Then I thought this would make a nice shot. Took my phone out and captured this photo. Smiling, because I was right. It was a nice shot. </p>

          <div class="six columns add-bottom">
            <h2>Taking a stroll along the beach, Kuantan</h2>
            <p><a href="#"><img width="220" height="220" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/31.JPG"></a>
  			   This is definitely one of my favorite shots. I was sitting while staring at the sea. Mesmerized by the view, suddenly this guy walk infront of me and I said to myself, "I will regret if I didnt capture this view". Took my phone out, and took this shot. I was satisfied with the result. </p>

            <p><a href="#"><img width="220" height="220" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/32.JPG"></a>
  			   This is also one of my favorite shot. I was walking with my friends. Randomly, I saw this old guy, walking really slowly and alone. I thought, life is a lonely road for sure. Then I took my phone and captured this shot, thinking "I have so much idea for this picture's caption" </p>
         </div>
          <div class="six columns add-bottom">
            <h2>Friendly clown, Bukit Tinggi, Pahang</h2>
            <p><a href="#"><img width="220" height="220" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/33.JPG"></a>
  			   Funny story is, I've always hated clowns. I couldnt even get close to them, I mean they are creepy. Right? But this one, he approched me so politely with his creepy makes up, but surprisingly, he didnt scared me. So I took a picture of him while he was making a "funny" face, that was what he said. This is the first clown have ever be my friend. Lol. </p>

          <div class="six columns add-bottom">

  			   I was amazed with this boy's spirit. It was scortching hot at that moment but he was happily waving the flag, proudly. I took my phone, while smiling and captured his photo. It is a great photo, indeed. </p>
